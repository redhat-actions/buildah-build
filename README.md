Buildah Build is a GitHub Action for building Docker and Kubernetes-compatible images quickly and easily.

[Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/master/docs) only works on Linux. GitHub's [Ubuntu Environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments#available-environments) (`ubuntu-18.04` and newer) come with buildah installed. If you are not using these environments, or if you want to use a different version, you must first [install buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/install.md).

After building your image, use [push-to-registry](https://github.com/redhat-actions/push-to-registry) to push the image and make it pullable.

<a id="dockerfile-build-inputs"></a>

### [Inputs for build from containerfile](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/main/docs/buildah-build.1.md)

| Input Name | Description | Default |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- |
| archs | Label the image with this architecture, instead of defaulting to the host architecture. Refer to [Multi arch builds](#multi-arch-builds) for more information. For multiple architectures, seperate them by a comma | None (host architecture)
| platforms | Label the image with this platform, instead of defaulting to the host platform. Refer to [Multi arch builds](#multi-arch-builds) for more information. For multiple platforms, seperate them by a comma | None (host platform)
| build-args | Build arguments to pass to the Docker build using `--build-arg`, if using a Containerfile that requires ARGs. Use the form `arg_name=arg_value`, and separate arguments with newlines. | None
| context | Path to directory to use as the build context. | `.`
| containerfiles\* | The list of Containerfile paths to perform a build using docker instructions. Separate filenames by newline. These are absolute paths, i.e they ignore the `context`. | **Required**
| extra-args | Extra args to be passed to `buildah bud`. Separate arguments by newline. Do not use quotes. | None
| image | Name to give to the output image. Refer to the [Image and Tag Inputs](#image-tag-inputs) section. | **Required** - unless all `tags` include image name
| layers | Set to true to cache intermediate layers during the build process. | None
| oci | Build the image using the OCI metadata format, instead of the Docker format. | `false`
| tags | One or more tags to give the new image. Separate by whitespace. Refer to the [Image and Tag Inputs](#image-tag-inputs) section. | `latest`
| labels | One or more labels to give the new image. Separate by newline. | None
| tls-verify | Require HTTPS and verify certificates when accessing the registry. Set to `false` to skip the verification | `true`

> \* The `containerfiles` input was previously `dockerfiles`. Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/redhat-actions/buildah-build/issues/57).

### Image and Tags Inputs
The `image` and `tags` inputs can be provided in one of two forms.

At least one tag must always be provided in `tags`. Multiple tags are separated by whitespace.

**Option 1**: Provide both `image` and `tags` inputs. The image will be built, and then tagged in the form `${image}:${tag}` for each tag.

For example:
```yaml
image: quay.io/my-namespace/my-image
tags: v1 v1.0.0
```
will create the image and apply two tags: `quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1` and `quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1.0.0`.

**Option 2**: Provide only the `tags` input, including the image name in each tag. The image will be built, and then tagged with each `tag`. In this case, the `image` input is ignored.

For example:
```yaml
# 'image' input is not set
tags: quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1 quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1.0.0
```
will also apply two tags: `quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1` and `quay.io/my-namespace/my-image:v1.0.0`.

If the `tags` input does not have image names in the `${name}:${tag}` form, then the `image` input must be set.

<a id="outputs"></a>

## Action Outputs

`image`: The name of the image as it was input.<br>
`tags`: A space-separated list of the tags that were applied to the new image.<br>
`image-with-tag`: The name of the image, tagged with the first tag.<br>

For example:

``` yml
image: "spring-image"
tags: "latest ${{ github.sha }}"
image-with-tag: "spring-image:latest"
```

## Build Types

You can configure the `buildah` action to build your image using one or more Containerfiles, or none at all.

<a id="build-using-dockerfile"></a>

### Building using Containerfiles

If you have been building your images with an existing Containerfile, `buildah` can reuse your Containerfile.

In this case the inputs needed are `image` and `containerfiles`. `tag` is also recommended. If your Containerfile requires ARGs, these can be passed using `build-arg`.

```yaml
name: Build Image using Containerfile
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Buildah Action
      uses: redhat-actions/buildah-build@v2
      with:
        image: my-new-image
        tags: v1 ${{ github.sha }}
        containerfiles: |
          ./Containerfile
        build-args: |
          some_arg=some_value
```
<a id="scratch-build"></a>

### Building without a Containerfile

Building without a Containerfile requires additional inputs, that would normally be specified in the Containerfile.

Do not set `containerfiles` if you are doing a build from scratch. Otherwise those Containerfiles will be used, and the inputs below will be ignored.

- An output `image` name and usually a `tag`.
- `base-image`
  - In a Containerfile, this would be the `FROM` directive.
- `content` to copy into the new image
  - In a Containerfile, this would be `COPY` directives.
- `entrypoint` so the container knows what command to run.
  - In a Containerfile, this would be the `ENTRYPOINT`.
- All other optional configuration inputs, such as `port`, `envs`, and `workdir`.

Example of building a Spring Boot Java app image:
```yaml
name: Build Image
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build image without Containerfile
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - run: mvn package

    - name: Build Image
      uses: redhat-actions/buildah-build@v2
      with:
        base-image: docker.io/fabric8/java-alpine-openjdk11-jre
        image: my-new-image
        tags: v1
        content: |
          target/spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
        entrypoint: java -jar spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
        port: 8080
```

## Multi arch builds

Refer to the [multi-arch example](./.github/workflows/multiarch.yml).

### Emulating RUN instructions

Cross-architecture builds from containerfiles containing `RUN` instructions require `qemu-user-static` emulation registered in the Linux kernel.

For example, run `sudo apt install qemu-user-static` on Debian hosts, or `sudo dnf install qemu-user-static` on Fedora.

You can run a [containerized version of the registration](https://hub.docker.com/r/tonistiigi/binfmt) if the package does not exist for your distribution:
```sh
sudo podman run --rm --privileged docker.io/tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```
This registration remains active until the host reboots.

### The `archs` and `platforms` inputs

The `archs` and `platforms` arguments override the Architecture and Platform labels in the output image, respectively. They do not actually affect the architectures and platforms the output image will run on. The image must still be built for the required architecture or platform.

There is a simple example [in this issue](https://github.com/redhat-actions/buildah-build/issues/60#issuecomment-876552452).

### Creating a Multi-Arch Image List

Input `archs` and `platforms` is provided to build the multi architecture images. If one of these input is provided with the multiple archs or platforms then a [manifest](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/main/docs/buildah-manifest.1.md) is built with the multiple architecture images. Name of the manifest is taken from the inputs `image` and `tags`.
Incase multiple tags are provided then multiple manifest is created based on the provided tags.

Use the `archs` and `platforms` inputs to build multi-architecture images. The name of the manifest is determined by the image and tags inputs.

If multiple tags are provided, multiple equivalent manifests will be created with the given tags.

[`push-to-registry`](https://github.com/redhat-actions/push-to-registry) action can be used to push the generated image manifest.

## Build with docker/metadata-action

Refer to the [docker/metadata-action example](./.github/workflows/docker_metadata_action.yml).

## Using private images

If your build references a private image, run [**podman-login**](https://github.com/redhat-actions/podman-login) in a step before this action so you can pull the image.
For example:

```yaml
- name: Log in to Red Hat Registry
  uses: redhat-actions/podman-login@v1
  with:
    registry: registry.redhat.io
    username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_USER }}
    password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_PASSWORD }}
```
